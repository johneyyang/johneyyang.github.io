I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to air pollution through my work as a Associate Research Scientist at [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/) of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/).
